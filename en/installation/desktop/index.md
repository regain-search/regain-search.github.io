Installation of the desktop variant of regain
=============================================

This article describes, how to install the [desktop variant](/en/project_info/variant_comparison/) of regain.

Installation
------------

At first you have to download regain from the [download page](http://regain.sourceforge.net/download.php).

Under Windows you may use the Windows-installer for installation, under other platforms you have to unpack the zip file.

Starting regain
---------------

regain must have been started if you want to search something. You recognise if regain is startet by the regain-symbol (a blue "r") in the task bar beside the clock.

The Windows-installer starts regain automatically. If you have downloaded the zip file, then you start regain by double clicking the file `regain.exe` resp. `regain.jar`.

If this doesn't work, enter the following commands in the console:


    cd ''[regain-Verzeichnis]''
    java -jar regain.jar

In order to start regain after every booting, you better create a link in the autostart folder. The installer does this automatically.

At the first start your browser will come up and show the welcome page.
