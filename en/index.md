Regain manual
=============

Welcome to the manual of [regain](http://regain.sf.net/).

regain is a search engine similar to web search engines like [Google](http://google.com/). Using regain you can search through large portions of data (several gigabytes!) in split seconds! This is possible by using a [search index](/en//components/search_index/). regain crawles through your files or webpages, extracts all text and puts it in a smart search index. All this happens in the background. So if you want to search something you get the results immediately.

There are two variants of regain: The desktop search and the server search. The **desktop search** is to be used on a normal desktop computer and it offers you a fast search for documents or intranet webpages. The **server search** you can install on web servers. It provides searching functionality for a website or for intranet fileservers. To learn more about the differernces of these two variants read the [Comparison of the regain variants](/en//project_info/variant_comparison/).
