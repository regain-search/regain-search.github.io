Sourcecode
==========

If you are interested in details of regain or if you want to fix a bug, you'll need the sourcecode.

There are several possibilites to get the sourcecode. You can either download the zipped source of a particular version or you can get the newest developer version directly from the SVN repository.


Sourcecode as .zip file
-----------------------

The zipped sourcecode of every version is available at the [files section](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=111168) of the sourceforge project site of regain.


Check out sourcecode from the SVN repository
--------------------------------------------

In order to load the source directly from the SVN repository, you have to install a SVN client first.

After that, you can check out the source with the following command:

    svn co https://regain.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/regain regain

This creates the directory `regain` including the whole source.

You need [ant](http://ant.apache.org/) to build. (See [How to setup an IDE](/en/project_info/project_info/howto_regain_in_an_ide/) for details.)

You can browse the SVN directory at [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/regain/develop).
